![Promethean Toolkit: Enabling Best Practices in IC Design & Test](core/common/logo_white.jpg?raw=true "Title")

# About
For an overview, start with: [Intro To Promethean Toolkit](help/introToPrometheanToolkit_Presentation.pdf)

Prometheus is known, among other things, as the Greek god of foresight. In IC design and test, a little foresight can pay large dividends later.
This is a tool made by IC designers for IC designers, based on decades of experience. It solves many of the most common problems encountered in design and testing of analog-mixed signal integrated circuits by centralizing the information the fully describes the state of your system. This centralization provides many advantages with regard to synchronization, reproducibility, traceability, and usability. It is all handled through a graphical environment and accompanying API that boosts productivity and increases insight, enabling rapid test automation and multi-user collaboration.

# Installation
Download the GitHub repo and then run `./PrometheanToolkit.m` in Matlab. In the GUI that pops up, go to the Help tab (last tab) and click on the "Intro to Promethean Toolkit" button in the top left corner of the Help tab. The file that opens up in your main Matlab Editor window will guide onward you from there. Good luck and godspeed!

# Getting Help
The built-in documentation of the Promethean Toolkit GUI, especially the 'Help' tab, contains the essential information needed to get up and running. However, if you are still stuck, find a bug, or need a feature, post it to the GitHub repo. Note that this is currently an unpaid project with a team size of one and user-base of...also one? So the odds of seeing additional documentation (e.g. tutorial videos), new features, etc, will be much higher if there is evidence of community interest in the project, and even better, community involvement in contributing to the project. ;-)
